# Digital Rain Innovation

## Repository
<https://github.com/HyunbinOh046/Final_Project.git>

## Description
- This project will modify the digital rain python code to create an authentic and artistic screen saver that inspires artists. 

## Features
- Random colors for the initial shape and following trails.
- Left mouse click to transform the background color.
- Some horizontal movement of the particles.

## Challenges 
- Setting up random colors for the particles. 
- Setting up the left mouse clicking function. 
- Figuring out how to move particles horizontally. 

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome: 
- The ideal outcome would be a digital rain with a random background color and a left mouse function to change it. And
  the movement of particles should be presented. 
Minimal Viable Outcome: 
- At least I can produce one of the features that would be the minimal viable outcome for this project. 

## Milestones
- Week 1 (Research PyGame documentation for modifications)
- Week 2 (Apply modifications in VS Code)
- Week 3 (Test and debug the issues in VS Code)
- Week 4 (Final check and submission)
